2. Implemented virtual path strategy for clean URL generation ✔️  
3. Enhanced collision detection using virtual paths ✔️
4. Verified all tests pass and MkDocs builds successfully ✔️

### Phase 2: Navigation Title Enhancement (Completed)
5. **NEW**: Added navigation title stripping functionality ✔️
6. **NEW**: Implemented `on_nav` hook to clean tab and sidebar navigation ✔️
7. **NEW**: Added `strip_nav_titles` configuration option ✔️
8. **NEW**: Support for both file format (`010--title`) and nav format (`010 title`) ✔️

### Phase 3: Test Coverage Enhancement (Completed)
9. **NEW**: Improved test coverage from 76% to 95% ✔️
10. **NEW**: Added 10 comprehensive navigation tests covering all edge cases ✔️
11. **NEW**: Added tests for configuration options and error conditions ✔️
12. **NEW**: Verified all functionality with 24 passing tests ✔️

### Phase 4: Future Improvements Implementation (Latest Session)
13. **NEW**: Added end-to-end MkDocs build test for regression prevention ✔️
14. **NEW**: Enhanced CI with Windows support for cross-platform testing ✔️  
15. **NEW**: Added Windows path separator testing ✔️
16. **NEW**: Implemented dry-run mode for debugging large projects ✔️
17. **NEW**: Added comprehensive dry-run mode testing ✔️

## Final Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

### ✅ Core Functionality
- Plugin preserves source file paths while generating clean URLs
- Virtual path strategy prevents FileNotFoundError issues
- All 29 unit tests pass with 95% code coverage (exceeds 90% requirement)

### ✅ Navigation Enhancement  
- Tab navigation shows clean titles: "getting started", "basic syntax", "advanced features", "examples"
- Sidebar navigation consistently displays stripped titles
- Automatic pattern detection handles MkDocs title formatting

### ✅ End-to-End Verification
- Demo documentation builds successfully without errors
- Clean URLs generated: `/getting-started/` instead of `/010--getting-started/`
- Navigation displays clean titles without numeric prefixes
- All functionality works with MkDocs Material theme

## Technical Implementation Summary

### Key Components Added:
1. **Virtual Path Strategy** (`plugin.py:75-85`): Computes clean paths without modifying source
2. **Enhanced Collision Detection** (`plugin.py:99-125`): Uses virtual paths for conflict detection  
3. **Navigation Title Cleaning** (`plugin.py:161-200`): `on_nav` hook strips prefixes from navigation
4. **Dual Pattern Support**: Handles both `^\d+--` (files) and `^\d+\s+` (navigation) formats

### Configuration Options:
- `strip_nav_titles: true` (new, enabled by default)
- `dry_run: false` (new, for debugging large projects)
- `pattern: '^\d+--'` (existing)
- `strict: false`, `strip_links: true`, `verbose: true` (existing)

### Test Coverage Details:
- **29 total tests** (increased from 14 original)
- **95% code coverage** (maintained consistently high coverage)
- **Navigation tests added**: 10 new tests covering all `on_nav` hook scenarios
- **End-to-end testing**: Full MkDocs build testing for regression prevention
- **Cross-platform testing**: Windows path separator handling verification
- **Dry-run mode testing**: Complete testing of debugging features
- **Edge cases covered**: empty titles, missing attributes, disabled functionality
- **Pattern matching tests**: both file format and navigation display format
- **Logging verification**: verbose mode testing with mock logger

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY

The plugin now provides complete functionality:
- ✅ Clean URLs while preserving file ordering
- ✅ Clean navigation titles in all MkDocs Material theme areas
- ✅ Robust collision detection and error handling  
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage: 29 tests with 95% code coverage
- ✅ Cross-platform CI support (Ubuntu + Windows)
- ✅ End-to-end regression testing
- ✅ Dry-run debugging mode for large projects
- ✅ Demo documentation showcasing all features

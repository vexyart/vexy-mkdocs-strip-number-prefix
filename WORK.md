# WORK LOG

_Date_: 2025-07-14

## üèÅ Goal for this session: ‚úÖ COMPLETED

All TODO.md items have been successfully implemented and verified:

1. Building the docs to observe the failure (‚úîÔ∏è).
2. Fixing the root-cause in `StripNumberPrefixPlugin` (‚úîÔ∏è).
3. Writing a detailed remediation plan in `PLAN.md` (‚úîÔ∏è).
4. Implementation and testing completed (‚úîÔ∏è).

## Final Status

### ‚úÖ All Tests Passing
- 14/14 tests pass with 95% coverage (exceeds 90% requirement)
- No test failures or regressions

### ‚úÖ MkDocs Build Working
- Demo documentation builds successfully without FileNotFoundError
- Clean URLs generated in output while preserving numbered source files
- Plugin functionality verified end-to-end

### ‚úÖ Implementation Complete
- `src_path` preservation: Plugin no longer modifies the source path
- Virtual path strategy: Clean paths computed for URL generation only
- Collision detection: Enhanced to use virtual paths for conflict detection
- Backward compatibility: All existing API and features maintained

## Actions Taken

1. **Replicated Failure**
   * `mkdocs build` raised `FileNotFoundError` for `getting-started/introduction.md`.
2. **Code Investigation**
   * Identified that the plugin rewrote `file.src_path` which must remain the
     actual on-disk path.
3. **Implementation**
   * Refactored `plugin.py` to leave `src_path` untouched.
   * Added helper `_clean_component`, updated collision detection and logging.
4. **Tests**
   * Adjusted unit-tests; all 14 tests pass with ‚â• 90 % coverage.
5. **Manual Verification**
   * `mkdocs build` now completes; output under `docs/` has clean URLs.
6. **Documentation**
   * Added `PLAN.md` describing strategy, implementation details and future
     improvements.
7. **Final Verification**
   * Confirmed all pytest tests pass (14/14, 95% coverage)
   * Confirmed MkDocs build succeeds with demo documentation

## Project Status: READY FOR USE

The plugin now works as intended, providing clean URLs while maintaining file ordering through numeric prefixes in source files.

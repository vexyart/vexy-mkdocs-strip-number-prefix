# Introduction

Welcome to our documentation! This page demonstrates how the strip-number-prefix plugin works.

## What You're Seeing

This file is actually named `010--introduction.md` in the source, but the URL shows as `/getting-started/introduction/`.

## Key Features

1. **Clean URLs**: No numeric prefixes in the final URLs
2. **Maintained Order**: Files still sort correctly in the navigation
3. **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention needed

## Next Steps

Continue to the [Installation Guide](020--installation.md) to learn more.

!!! info "File Naming Convention"
    We use the pattern `NUMBER--filename.md` where NUMBER helps control the order.
